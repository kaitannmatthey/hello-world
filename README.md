My first repository.

Hello, world!

My name is Kait. My first love is Java, but I've branched out to learn and even teach introductory courses on HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Python, C#, and C++. I'd really like to become more well versed professionally in all of these languages, and get some solid work done that I can show off. I'm a big sponge! Wish me luck!
